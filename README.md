# Daily Ledger

One small entry. Every day.

This repo adds a single meaningful line per day:
- the date
- a thought worth keeping
- a quick signal from the world or work

> The README is updated daily by an automated script that pulls in a small slice of what’s happening out there.  
> Think of it as a living artifact, not a dashboard.

## Rules (kept simple)

- One entry per day.
- Append only.
- Must mean something.
